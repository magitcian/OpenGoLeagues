# OpenGoLeagues project

## Description
This website provides an environment where one can organize and manage Go leagues easily, register and participate to leagues created by other peoples, but also allows to analyze suspicious games with Leela-Zero in order to find if a player has cheated in his games (for instance by using the help of a strong Go-bot while playing).
